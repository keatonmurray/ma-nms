                        It’s a busy spring for the band as it is, between their current run of overseas dates and an upcoming North American run supporting In Flames this April and May. Today (March 26th), Gatecreeper announced they’ll just stay on the road from there, starting their own headlining run on May 28th in Santa Fe.

                        As previously reported, the supernaturally-themed Dark Superstition is the first Gatecreeper full-length since 2019's Deserted, though it follows 2021 mini-album An Unexpected Reality. The album was produced and mixed by Converge tone master Kurt Ballou at his iconic God City Studios in Salem, Massachusetts.
